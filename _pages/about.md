I am an Applied Physics PhD student at the University of Michigan interested in high resolution global climate models. I am advised by [Christiane Jablonowski](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~cjablono/) and [Brian Arbic](https://arbic.earth.lsa.umich.edu/).

## Current Research Interests
* Variability of stratospheric motions in climate models
* Precipitation variance spectra in high resolution climate models
* Nonhydrostatic coupled climate models
