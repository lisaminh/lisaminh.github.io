I am an Applied Physics PhD student at the University of Michigan interested in high resolution global climate models. I am in the [Atmospheric Modeling Working Group(ADMG)](https://admg.engin.umich.edu/) and advised by [Christiane Jablonowski](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~cjablono/) and [Brian Arbic](https://arbic.earth.lsa.umich.edu/).

## Current Research Interests
* Stratospheric Dynamics and Variability in climate models
* Precipitation variance spectra in high resolution climate models
* Nonhydrostatic coupled climate models
* Feedback-controller algorithms for simulating stratospheric aerosol injections (SAI)
