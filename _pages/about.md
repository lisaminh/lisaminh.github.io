I am an Applied Physics PhD student at the University of Michigan interested in high resolution global climate models. I am in the [Hydroclimatic Extremes, Impacts and Data Analytics (HEIDA)](https://www.ombadi.com/) and advised by [Mohammed Ombadi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=huRvHmgAAAAJ&hl=en)

## Current Research Interests
* Drought Synchronicity in a Warming Climate
* Stratospheric Dynamics and Variability in climate models
* Precipitation variance spectra in high resolution climate models
* Feedback-controller algorithms for simulating stratospheric aerosol injections (SAI)
