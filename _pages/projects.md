## Investigating Stratopheric Circulation in the DoE climate model E3SMv2 (CMIP6 protocol)
There is a need to understand how well our climate models capture stratospheric motions, especially motivated by climate intervention techniques, such as stratospheric aerosol injections. This work investigates the stratopheric circulation of the DoE's earth system model [E3SMv2](https://e3sm.org/), run under [CMIP6](https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip-phase-6-cmip6/) guidelines. This work will be used in assessing the variability of the stratosphere and is funded by the [CLDERA Grand Challenge](https://www.sandia.gov/cldera/).  

## Proportional-Integral Feedback Controller for simulation Stratospheric Aerosol Injections
Simulating stratospheric aerosol injections (SAI) can range from a simple "dimming" of the sun's radiation to representing the complete chemical interactions that occur in the stratosphere. This work uses a proportional-integral feedback controller, adapted from [dan-visioni](https://github.com/dan-visioni/feedback_suite) that adjusts the rate of the aerosol injection at specified locations based on simultaneously controlling for three temperature metrics. This was to be used in a modified model of E3SMv2, that included a more complete chemical description of the stratosphere. This work was done at Sandia National Laboratory in the [FORCEE internship](https://sandia.jobs/albuquerque-nm/intern-future-of-research-for-climate-earth-energy-forcee-rd-undergraduate-summer/80ACD05058474C108C6F99AAABD24CC8/job/?vs=7104&utm_source=PostDocJobs.com-DE&utm_medium=Other&utm_campaign=PostDocJobs.com)

## Precipitation Variance Spectra in Rain Gauges vs Models
Precipitation projections in climate models contain large amounts of uncertainty and suffer from a "drizzle effect", where the model output precipitation is always lightly raining. As climate models increase their spatial resolution, we would hope to more accurately capture the more extreme precipitation events that have profound impacts on our society. This study looks at the power spectrum of the precipitation variance of low, medium, and high resolution models and compares them to rain gauge information. The goal is to understand if increasing resolution can capture the high frequency high intensity rain events that we see in observation.
